Create a React component renders two inputs: One for a post title and one for  post content. When text is written into the inputs, it should update the state of the component and visually show what is currently held in the component state.

 Then, add a button to the component. When the button is clicked, the state of the application is updated and the latest post is held as an object in the component’s state. The latest post is then shown below the inputs.

When the button is clicked again, the state should continue to update to show what the latest post is.
